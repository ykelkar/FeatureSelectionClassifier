# Feature Selection Classifier

Implemented search algorithm to find the best feature subset in a dataset to classify an object using:

1. Forward Selection
2. Backward Elimination

## What I Learned
* Using K-Nearest-Neightbor algorithm
* Implementing Forward Selection and Backward Elimination

## Usage
* Compile main.cpp
* Input file to test
* Input number for algorithm to use 1) Forward Selection 2) Backward Elimination
